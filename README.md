# Frontend-developer
We have created a case that could reflect the day-to-day work for a frontend developer in our team. We do not expect you to spend more than 4 hours on this task (and it is perfectly fine not to be able to do the entire work within this time limit).  

## Assignment - need to have
* Create a new project using Vue or React.
* Using this API, https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php, get a list of albums from your favorite artist, and present them in the app.
* Create a list view and a card view of the data and a switch to toggle between these states. The state must be persisted in some kind of storage of your own choice, so that the view is restored on browser reloads. 
* Create a detail view where you can show information for each album from the API. You choose what information to show.
* Make it possible to navigate back to the list view.
* Implement the design from this Figma file. (https://www.figma.com/proto/IWlpD8Uk4qRYNwPl83UP3G/FE-Case?type=design&node-id=1-123&t=5Ek1nxqY9doTqQZW-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A123)
* Icons can be found in the svg folder of this repo.

## Optional â€“ nice to have 
* Create one or more tests for the app using a suitable testing framework demonstrating your experience with testing.
* Implement a rating system for each album. 

## Delivery 
Please supply a link to your git repo with your solution.
The project should be able to run via pnpm, npm or yarn.
